# [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) Data Engineering Projects

This repo contains the projects I completed as part of Dataquest's Data Engineering path. The goal was to learn how to build data pipelines to work with large datasets.

Every project has its own README with specifics regarding that project.

### Project 1: Storing Storm Data
### Project 2: Optimizing Dataframes and Processing in Chunks
